# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, needed help completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The tasks to be completed included:

1. Calculating the total number of votes cast.
2. Getting a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
Resources for this project included:
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
1. There were 369,711 votes cast.
2. The candidates receiving votes were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
3. and 4. The voting results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane  received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
5. The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
The election data was tabulated into a comma-separated values file which proved to be easy to analyze as it was well-formatted and had no missing or error-riddled data, such as mispelled candidate names. 

## Challenge Summary
Tom can rest easy knowing that, thanks to Python and Visual Studio Code, we know who won the election and by what margin.
